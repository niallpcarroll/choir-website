<h2>Church Documents on Sacred Music</h2>
<p>Here are the most relevant Church documents dealing with the subject of sacred music:</p>
<ul>
    <li><h3>Tra le Sollecitudini</h3>
    <p>Issued by Pope St Pius X in 1903, <a href="https://adoremus.org/1903/11/tra-le-sollecitudini/" target="_blank"><i>Tra le Sollecitudini</i></a> was a key document in the revival of Gregorian chant, and it contains an excellent explanation of what sacred music is.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Musicae Sacrae Disciplina</h3>
    <p>The 1955 encyclical of Ven. Pope Pius XII, <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/pius-xii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_25121955_musicae-sacrae.html" target="_blank"><i>Musicae sacrae disciplina</i></a>, reaffirms the duty of Church musicians to preserve Latin plainchant and to preserve the dignity of sacred music in general.</p></li>
    <li><h3>De Musica Sacra</h3>
        <p>The Sacred Congregation of Rites issued <a href="https://adoremus.org/1958/09/instruction-on-sacred-music/" target="_blank"><i>De musica sacra</i></a> in September 1958. Apart from reaffirming previous norms, it deals with topical issues such as sound amplification, the use of "automatic" instruments and pre-recorded music.</p>

    </li>
    <li><h3>Sacrosanctum Concilium</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html" target="_blank"><i>Sacrosanctum concilium</i></a> was the first document issued by the Second Vatican Council. Although it deals with the sacred liturgy in general, Chapter VI deals specifically with sacred music. Although sometimes cited as a revolutionary document, it largely reaffirms the teachings of previous pontiffs.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Musicam Sacram</h3>
    <p>Issued by the Sacred Congregation of Rites in 1967, <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_instr_19670305_musicam-sacram_en.html" target="_blank"><i>Musicam sacram</i></a> is the last major document issued by the Church on the subject of sacred music. It looks at questions such as the place of the vernacular in sacred music, the use of Gregorian chant, musical instruments, and the "hierarchy" of sung texts in the liturgy. </p></li>
